          Farewell from SparkSeat
        </h2>

        <p class="has-text-justified">
          We launched SparkSeat in November 2013 after a particularly confusing hour of form-filling in Teviot Row House at Edinburgh University,
          and it's there nearly five years and over 85,000 tickets later that we made the decision to close our doors.
        </p>

        <p class="has-text-justified">
          We didn't take this decision lightly, however with the four of us having full time jobs,
          we no longer feel able to dedicate the time needed to provide the great service you deserve.
        </p>

        <p class="has-text-justified">
          We've learned a lot from running SparkSeat, and are immensely grateful that so many of you have supported us,
          worked with us and trusted us to provide your box office services.
        </p>

        <p class="has-text-justified">
          Thank you once again for your support, it's been an absolute blast.
        </p>

        <p class="has-text-justified">
          Sincerely,<br>
          Craig, Hayden, Lewis and Mihaela
